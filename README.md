CHALLENGES WE FACED AND HOW WE SOLVED THEM
As it was the first time for us collaborating remotely on a project. We faced quite a few challenges while developing the clone. The challenges we can remember are as follows:-
Git was fairly new to us and thus it became a challenge to merge the code and solve the conflicts. Sometimes we worked till 2 am just to merge the code and improve the final version afterward.
Another challenge was solving the problem of redundant CSS classes. It happened sometimes that there were few redundant classes and the output used to get disoriented. Solving it required a thorough checkup of class names and effective communication among us so that we could prevent it from happening.
We had to learn how to make animations and carousels as few sections of some pages required us to create image cards, moving navbar, opening & closing a![Screenshot (211 
nimations, etc. Here, reading the documentation and looking at the snippets come in handy to solve such problems.
As we are not using and UI libraries yet, we faced a lot of challenges while getting a similar layout on different screen sizes. Although we were able to manage most of it, this issue is something that we got to know could only be resolved with the UI libraries (which we have not studied yet), so we decide to move on and fix other things.
